(NDOH HTS / PEP / PrEP guidance.)",
    "Mental-health Risk HIGH (possible suicidality or severe distress): Immediate safety assessment is required. Follow emergency mental-health pathways: implement safety plan, do not leave the person alone, arrange urgent psychiatric/medical assessment or 72-hour involuntary assessment where indicated.
